              some high school, high school or some college), whereas over half of groups C and E have higher levels of education (i.e. associate degree, bachelor degree or masters degree). It is particularaly interesting to see Group E in this light,
              as although in the previous graph we thought that Group E were lower in relation to parental level of education, we see that this was skewed due to the low numbers in this group. However, when looking at the percentages <strong>within the group</strong>,
              they are among the most highly educated.</p>
